[see below - the US supplied Stalin, Stalin supplied China]\n\nStalin's \u201cgenerosity\u201d was the result of the Soviet scheme to provoke the Sino-Japanese War in order to make China into a blood pool to tie down Japan, an exact word used by Vasily Ivanovich Chuikov in his memoirs to describe the effect of the Sino-Japanese War on the Soviet Union.\n\n_________________________\n\nThe itemized amounts were merely:\n\n\u2022 US$26 million (1941, mostly squandered in Burma in the aftermath of the Japanese invasion),\n\n\u2022 US$100 million (1942),\n\n\u2022 US$49 million (1943), and\n\n\u2022 US$53 million (1944).\n\n(Numbers were from Arthur Young, economic adviser to the Republic of China and one of the few Americans who harbored true sympathy with China and the Chinese people.\n\n_________________________\n\nFor comparison's sake, we want to list the amounts from the communist money laundering:\n\ni) Chen Hansheng's laundering 20 million US dollars to Yenan through the CPUSA and the leftist and communist front organizations in the U.S.;\n\nii) communist actress Wang Ying's donation collection activities in Southeast Asia, that could amount to 10-20 million US dollars; and the Japanese foreign ministry's funneling of over 3 billion yens of funds to the Chinese communists through SPY Pan Hannian, equivalent to 25 million US dollars, according to Endo Homare, the only survivor of her family from the 1948 communist siege and blockade of Changchun that led to the starvation death of 300,000 civilians.\n\n_________________________\n\nThe American aid to China was completely sabotaged by\n\ni) the colonialists and\n\nii) the communists inside of the U.S. government.\n\nThe American Production Mission to China wasn't set up until September '44.\n\n_________________________\n\nPer Edwin Locke, \"Well, the problem had just never been attended to before, for one thing; and for another, we were just getting into a position where militarily we could supply a lot more help to China. You see, China was at the end of the line before; she was almost an orphan, and we didn't do very much more than maintain Chennault and his hundred airplanes there in South China, until we began building big bomber bases in China for bombing Japan.\n\nChina then began to assume a great deal more importance. I think this is your reason...\" Rather receiving any benefits from the lend lease, the Chinese side had spent enormous resource on supporting the American operation. The airfields completely bankrupted China's wartime finance and led to spiraling inflation from 1942 to 1945, which replayed again from 1947 to 1949 when George Marshall left China.\n\nWellington Koo's memoirs often talked about some amount related to the INVERSE LEND LEASE, an amount that the Americans owed to China. Wellington Koo, throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, were constantly working with the Americans to balance out the dollar amount of aid from the Americans and the dollar amount of the financial support that R.O.C. provided to the Americans.\u201d\n\nhttps://t.co/uGwNPl4LdG\n\nEdwin A.

Through its foreign policy, the USSR supported global socialist and communist movements, aiming to dismantle Western capitalist influence, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This ideological commitment to \u201cliberation\u201d was often contradictory, as nations \u201cfreed\u201d from imperialist powers frequently fell under strict Soviet control, trading one form of dominance for another, particularly in Eastern Europe. While promoting anti-imperialism and global solidarity, Soviet liberation largely served to expand Soviet influence, blending ideological aims with geopolitical strategy.\n\nThe influence of Soviet liberation ideology in the United States began in the early 20th century, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, as the Communist International promoted anti-colonial and anti-racist struggles. The Soviet Union saw the fight against racial oppression in the U.S. as part of its challenge to Western capitalist power, and the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) framed racial inequality as a form of class struggle and imperialist oppression. By the 1960s, with the rise of the Black Power movement, groups like the Black Panther Party were influenced by Marxist and anti-imperialist ideas, interpreting Black liberation as part of a global fight against oppression. Soviet ideology thus indirectly influenced Black militant movements, which adapted these ideas to address racial and economic inequalities unique to the U.S.", "url": "https://x.com/algxtradingx/status/1855747821351358631"}, {"description": "Ignoring the Soviet ideological context and domestic American personnel creates an inexcusable myopia. Let me explain.\nAm surprised you don't remember that Stalinist ideological doctrine posed the irremediable and inevitable military conflict between capitalist and socialism. Throughout the 1920s and especially the 1930s, it was Soviet state doctrine and practice to seek the overthrow of \"bourgeois\" Western governments through subversion by local communist parties.\nThis doctrinal axiom continued to animate Soviet foreign policy up until Stalin's death in 1953 and a few years beyond. After 1945 (of course FDR died that year), the dominant Soviet ideological and academic view was that capitalism was headed into a death spiral that would make war with the socialist system inevitable, not excluding a nuclear-weapon exchange. The paradigmatic counterview was articulated by Eugene Varga, who was condemned for it and did not re-emerge politically until 1956.\nAt the same time, it would be difficult to argue that the US \"deep state\" under FDR\u2014represented at the time by such figures as Harry Dexter White, Harry Hopkins, Alger Hiss, Francis Sayre, and Noel Field to name but a handful\u2014was \"hostile to Russia\". I trust that you will appreciate the understatement here. It is arguably they who were responsible for FDR's \"naive hopes\", which were dashed not by any \"deep state\" but rather by the actually-existing realities of Soviet doctrine, ideology, strategy, and tactics.", "url": "https://x.com/RobertMCutler/status/1855584008219800063"}, {"description": "Well, I appreciate the question, but I\u2019d suggest revisiting the history of Ronald Reagan\u2019s approach to the Soviet Union, particularly his 1982 Westminster Speech, which marked a pivotal shift away from mere containment toward a strategy of liberation and ideological confrontation. Reagan\u2019s policy wasn\u2019t a cautious or passive approach\u2014it was a bold recalibration aimed at empowering movements within the Soviet sphere and exposing the weaknesses of the Soviet system. Rather than acquiescing to Soviet power, he sought to undermine it through both direct and indirect support, using moral and political influence to advocate for self-determination across Eastern Europe.\n\nReagan understood the value of \u201cplaying with the pawns\u201d to achieve strategic gains, which involved backing dissident movements, supporting information flows into closed societies, and exerting relentless pressure on the USSR diplomatically and economically. This wasn\u2019t a policy of fearing escalation but of carefully calibrated moves that demonstrated strength and commitment to ideals of freedom. It\u2019s a lesson worth considering today: deterrence and liberation require the courage to make bold, principled moves, not only playing defense but seizing opportunities to challenge authoritarianism directly.", "url": "https://x.com/SlawomirDebski/status/1853987576979370268"}, {"description": "\"Maxim Gorky spoke to the Communist youth organization in 1933 of 'the heroic deed of Pioneer Pavlik Morozov, the boy who understood that a person who is a relative by blood may well be an enemy of the spirit, and that such a person is not to be spared'.\n\nGorky was an ally and favourite of Stalin's, but this particular initiative does not seem to have been to Stalin's taste, at least according to rumour: \"What a little swine, denouncing his own father,\" is one remark attributed to Stalin.\"\nhttps://t.co/SuYNfzWiAm", "url": "https://x.com/triangulation16/status/1855369127696675006"}, {"description": "Those who vote decide nothing.

I\u2019m what you call a decent human being, I will NOT drag your name through the mud over this. Just respectfully if you subscribe to someone & you are the only subscriber to that streamer & you can\u2019t afford to keep subbing just cancel it. \n\nSaves a bit of time cause I genuinely thought it\u2019d go away but no I now got to pay that back. I\u2019m not mad at all I\u2019m just putting it out there.
