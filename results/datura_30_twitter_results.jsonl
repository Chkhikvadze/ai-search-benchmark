Both for oneself and others.\n\nFulfillment or Eudaimonia - Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"well-being,\" suggests that the goal of life is to achieve one's full potential through virtues. This involves leading a life of moral integrity, where one's actions align with reason and virtue.\n\nMeaning or Purpose - Existentialists might argue that the goal is to find personal meaning, which differs for each individual. This could involve creating art, contributing to society, understanding the universe, or personal growth.\n\nFreedom - Some might see the ultimate goal as achieving freedom in various forms: freedom from oppression, freedom from want, or existential freedom where one is free to define and redefine oneself.\n\nConnection or Love - For many, the aim might be to form deep connections with others, through family, friendship, or romantic relationships, where love and understanding are paramount.\n\nEnlightenment or Transcendence - In many Eastern philosophies, like Buddhism or Hinduism, the goal might be enlightenment, liberation (Moksha), or Nirvana, where one transcends the cycle of birth and death, moving beyond suffering.\n\nSurvival and Reproduction - From a purely biological standpoint, the goal could be seen as survival, reproduction, and the continuation of one's genetic lineage.\n\nKnowledge and Understanding - For others, the pursuit of knowledge, science, and understanding the universe might be the highest aim.\n\nService or Contribution - Some might believe the purpose is to serve others or contribute to society in a meaningful way, which could align with religious teachings or humanistic values.\n\nMoney - While often seen as a means rather than an end, some might view the accumulation of wealth as the goal, either for security, power, or the freedom it provides to pursue other interests.\n\nMoney, Freedom, and Happiness:\n\nMoney: It's generally regarded as a means to an end rather than the end itself. Money can provide security, freedom, and the means to pursue happiness, but it isn't happiness itself.\n\nFreedom: This can be considered both a means and an end. Freedom allows one to pursue any of the other goals listed here, but freedom for freedom's sake might be seen as an ultimate goal by those who value autonomy above all else.\n\nHappiness: Often considered a primary goal, but it's complex because happiness can be fleeting. Sustainable happiness might involve achieving several of the above goals in balance.\n\nUltimately, the end goal of life might not be singular. It could be a combination of these elements, tailored to the individual's values, experiences, and worldview. Many would argue that life's purpose might not be predefined but something one actively shapes through their actions and choices.", "url": "https://x.com/Mohit12425/status/1855514223402508783"}, {"description": "The Greeks understood that virtue and happiness are essentially the same thing, they called it eudaimonia. One of the disservices we fail our youth with is to teach them that happiness and pleasure are the same thing. \n\nNow, while there's by no means anything inherently wrong with pleasure, so by all means enjoy your meal, and happiness generates pleasure, pleasure and happiness are not the same thing. Eating a bag of sweets generates pleasure, levelling up some aspect of yourself makes for happiness. The danger comes in when you confuse the two as the same thing. The pleasant sensations you get from eating an ice cream are not on the same level, nor as sustainable, as the pleasure generated by genuine happiness which is caused by the application of virtue, or by living virtuously. Such as having suffered to achieve something special, for example, or to have been proved right after showing moral courage in spite of the madness of more fashionable crowds.\n\nTo think that happiness can be attained by the purely material endeavours, such as by eating lots of sweets or making lots of money, leads to moral corruption and ultimately, one kind of hell, if not the other. A hugely successful man, for example a powerful mobster, can have access to far more pleasure than the average person is capable of attaining, such as expensive restaurants, cars, and so on, but is poetically denied the higher order of pleasure afforded by happiness, which, in turn comes from the application of virtue.

At its peak, the Roman Empire stretched from Scotland to Arabia, and contained perhaps a quarter of humanity. It was the wealthiest and most formidable state the world had yet seen.\n\nBeginning in 69AD, a year that saw four Caesars in succession rule the empire, and ending some seven decades later with the death of Hadrian, Pax presents a dazzling history of Rome at the height of its power. From the gilded capital to realms beyond the frontier, historian Tom Holland portrays the Roman Empire in all its predatory glory. Vivid scene follows vivid scene: the destruction of Jerusalem and Pompeii, the building of the Colosseum and Hadrian's Wall, the conquests of Trajan. Vividly sketching the lives of Romans both ordinary and spectacular, from slaves to emperors, Holland demonstrates how Roman peace was the fruit of unprecedented military violence.\n\nA stunning portrait of Rome's glory days, this is the epic history of the pax Romana.", "url": "https://x.com/romanhistory1/status/1855365946900468176"}, {"description": "Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, Held as the Apex of Western Literature - The #Aeneid is held up as the best of western #literature.
