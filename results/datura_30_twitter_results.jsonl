This trend of shortening the exclusive theatrical window before streaming availability has raised concerns in the industry, as seen with the contrasting success of films like \"Inside Out 2,\" which had a three-month exclusive theatrical run before streaming. Johansson's lawsuit reflects broader frustrations within Hollywood regarding the changing landscape of film distribution and its financial implications for actors and filmmakers.\n        \n\n**Summary:** Scarlett Johansson's lawsuit against Disney in 2021 stemmed from the simultaneous release of her film \"Black Widow\" in theaters and on Disney+, which she claimed adversely affected the film's box office performance and, consequently, her earnings tied to theatrical success. This legal action highlighted significant industry concerns regarding the trend of reducing the exclusive theatrical window before films are made available for streaming. The contrasting success of other films, such as \"Inside Out 2,\" which enjoyed a three-month exclusive theatrical run before streaming, underscores the financial implications of these distribution strategies.

Here's the lowdown in terms even a space-faring AI can understand:\n\n- **What It Is**: Imagine you're at a party (a very quantum party). The Higgs boson is like the host who makes sure everyone has a bit of space to themselves. It's the particle associated with the Higgs field, which gives other particles mass.\n\n- **The Hunt**: Scientists were chasing this elusive particle for decades, not because they wanted to give it a birthday party, but to confirm the Higgs field, a fundamental part of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\n- **Discovery**: It was finally \"seen\" at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012. They didn't actually see the particle but observed its decay products, kind of like piecing together what a cake looked like from the crumbs.\n\n- **Why It Matters**: This particle helps explain why some particles have mass (and thus form atoms, stars, you, me) while others, like photons, zip around massless at the speed of light. \n\n- **The Drama**: There was much fanfare, Nobel Prizes were awarded, and physicists everywhere did a little dance for finally catching this quantum celebrity.\n\nIn essence, the Higgs boson is crucial because it's the key to understanding how mass comes about in our universe.

Initially, Stalin sought to forge an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers through the Popular Fronts, aiming to align socialist movements with bourgeois interests. However, when this approach failed, he pivoted to a pragmatic alliance with Nazi Germany, culminating in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939. This agreement not only facilitated the division of Eastern Europe, including the joint occupation of Poland and the annexation of the Baltic states, but also provided Germany with crucial resources that bolstered its military capabilities. The pact marked a stark shift in Soviet policy, reflecting a willingness to collaborate with a fascist regime to secure territorial gains and influence. Despite these actions, Stalin's earlier attempts to ally with the UK and France against Hitler are often overlooked, highlighting the complex geopolitical landscape of the time and the challenges of maintaining international commitments amidst rising tensions.\n        \n\n**Summary:**  \nSoviet foreign policy from 1933 to 1939 was characterized by significant shifts, primarily influenced by Joseph Stalin's strategic goals.
