While it's true that Earth's rotation period relative to fixed stars (sidereal day) is about 86,164.0989 seconds and celestial bodies appear to move westward at 15\u00ac\u221e/h, the question incorrectly assumes that the Sun's apparent diameter remains constant over 24 hours. In reality, the Sun's apparent diameter is roughly 0.5\u00ac\u221e and doesn't change significantly in 24 hours. The question mixes the concept of sidereal day with solar day, and incorrectly implies that the Sun's apparent motion can be measured in 'apparent diameters' over a full day. A solar day is about 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day, so the Sun doesn't complete a full 360\u00ac\u221e apparent rotation in exactly 24 hours.
