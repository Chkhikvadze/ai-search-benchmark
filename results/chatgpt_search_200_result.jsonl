Initially, Robinson was known for his electro and complextro tracks, such as \"Say My Name\" and the EP Spitfire. However, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the electronic dance music (EDM) genre, feeling it limited his creative freedom. He mentioned experiencing multiple anxiety attacks during performances and expressed frustration with the genre's focus on entertainment over artistic expression. \nWIKIPEDIA\n\nIn 2012, after the success of \"Language,\" Robinson decided to prioritize \"beauty\" and \"emotion\" in his music, aiming to create something \"sincere\" and \"honest.\" He sought to produce music that resonated with his personal experiences and emotions, moving away from the formulaic structures common in festival-oriented EDM. This shift led to the creation of Worlds, an album that integrates elements from anime, films, and 1990s video games, reflecting his interests and evoking nostalgia. \nWIKIPEDIA\n\nRobinson's primary inspirations for Worlds included Daft Punk's Discovery and Kanye West's Graduation, both of which influenced his approach to melody and emotion in electronic music. By embracing these influences, he crafted an album that departed from his previous style, focusing on melodic and emotional depth. \nWIKIPEDIA\n\nThis evolution in Robinson's music highlights his commitment to artistic growth and his desire to create music that is both personally meaningful and resonant with his audience.\n"}, "search_results": [{"link": "https://edmhousenetwork.com/celebrating-10-years-of-porter-robinsons-worlds-album/", "title": "Celebrating 10 Years of Porter Robinson\u2019s \u2018Worlds\u2019 Album", "description": "August 11, 2024 \u2014 With the release of his debut album came a whole new side of Porter Robinson for everyone to hear.

In fact, using sunscreen is a crucial measure in preventing skin cancer. Skin cancers, including melanoma and non-melanoma types, are primarily caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Sunscreen acts as a barrier, protecting the skin from harmful UV rays that can lead to DNA damage and subsequent cancer development. \nSKIN CANCER FOUNDATION\n\nThere is no scientific evidence supporting the claim that sunscreen causes skin cancer. On the contrary, studies have shown that regular use of sunscreen can significantly reduce the risk of developing skin cancers. For instance, research indicates that daily use of SPF 15 sunscreen can lower the risk of squamous cell carcinoma by about 40% and melanoma by 50%. \nSKIN CANCER FOUNDATION\n\nIt's important to apply sunscreen correctly and consistently. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and reapply it every two hours, or more frequently if swimming or sweating. Additionally, combining sunscreen use with other protective measures\u2014such as wearing protective clothing, seeking shade, and avoiding peak sun hours\u2014can further reduce the risk of skin damage and cancer. \nCANCER RESEARCH UK\n\nIn summary, sunscreen is a vital tool in the prevention of skin cancer and does not contribute to its development.\n"}, "search_results": [{"link": "https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sunscreen-safety/", "title": "Sunscreen Safety - The Facts - The Skin Cancer Foundation", "description": "July 1, 2024 \u2014 Influencers are spreading misinformation about sunscreen safety; inclulding claims that it may cause skin cancer.

{"id": "9ee3adad-89ab-4f0e-bda3-7ae22a3456e7", "question": "efficiency of quantum tunneling photosynthesis in cacti", "result": {"answerText": "Quantum tunneling is a fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon where particles pass through energy barriers that would be insurmountable in classical physics. In photosynthesis, this effect is believed to play a role in the efficient transfer of energy within light-harvesting complexes. However, the specific contribution of quantum tunneling to photosynthetic efficiency in cacti has not been extensively studied.\n\nCacti primarily utilize Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis, a pathway adapted to arid environments. CAM photosynthesis involves the nocturnal fixation of CO\u2082 into organic acids, which are then decarboxylated during the day to release CO\u2082 for the Calvin cycle, minimizing water loss during the day. While CAM photosynthesis is known for its water-use efficiency, the role of quantum tunneling in this process remains unclear.\n\nResearch into quantum effects in photosynthesis has predominantly focused on the light-harvesting complexes of plants and algae, where phenomena like quantum coherence and tunneling are thought to enhance energy transfer efficiency. For instance, studies have explored resonant tunneling in natural photosynthetic systems, suggesting that quantum effects can contribute to the high internal quantum efficiency observed in higher plants. \nARXIV\n\nHowever, the application of these findings to CAM photosynthesis in cacti is limited. The unique metabolic pathways and environmental adaptations of cacti may influence the relevance and impact of quantum tunneling in their photosynthetic processes. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which quantum tunneling contributes to the efficiency of photosynthesis in cacti.\n"}, "search_results": [{"link": "https://scitechdaily.com/natures-quantum-code-unraveling-the-secrets-of-photosynthesis/", "title": "Nature\u2019s Quantum Code: Unraveling the Secrets of Photosynthesis", "description": "August 21, 2023 \u2014 A cutting-edge experiment has unveiled the quantum dynamics underlying one of nature\u2019s most essential processes.

Megan opens up about the critical challenges she's faced since her rise to fame in 2018, including the death of her mother, Holly Thomas, who passed away from brain cancer in 2019. In the film, she painfully recounts her decision to pull the plug on her mother's life support. The documentary also delves into her tumultuous legal battle with Tory Lanez, who was convicted of shooting her in 2020. Megan experiences significant emotional and social fallout from this incident, leading to feelings of betrayal by her former friend Kelsey Nicole Harris, who was present during the event and later testified. To cope with her trauma, Megan attended a mental health retreat in 2022 after experiencing suicidal thoughts. The retreat provided various therapies that helped her regain stability. The film captures her relief and gratitude when Lanez was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2023. Megan states that she is now focused on self-care for her well-being."}]}

This includes string literals and other constants embedded directly into the program's binary. For example, the string literal \"Hello, world!\" has the 'static lifetime because it is hardcoded into the program and exists for its entire execution.\n\nTo explicitly specify the 'static lifetime in your code, you can annotate references as follows:\n\nrust\nCopy code\nfn main() {\n    let s: &'static str = \"Hello, world!\";\n    println!(\"{}\", s);\n}\n\n\nIn this example, s is a reference to a string slice with the 'static lifetime, indicating that it is valid for the entire duration of the program.\n\nIt's important to note that while 'static data is always available, using it inappropriately can lead to inefficient memory usage.

The city's largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, will not participate in December\u2019s district council elections for the first time since its 1994 inception. New electoral rules require candidates to secure nominations from at least nine members of local pro-government committees, a hurdle even some pro-government politicians found challenging. The overhaul has largely eliminated directly elected seats, significantly reducing the pro-democracy camp's political representation. The changes reflect the shrinking space for pro-democracy movements amid a government crackdown since 2019\u2019s protests. Central government officials emphasized that those who are not patriots are unqualified to run, though they could realign their stance over time to demonstrate patriotism. The district councils, previously focused on municipal matters, gained prominence after a pro-democracy landslide victory in the 2019 elections during the height of anti-government protests. The absence of pro-democracy groups in the current election marks a significant shift in Hong Kong's political landscape."}]}

While some studies have detected oxybenzone in the bloodstream after sunscreen application, there is currently no conclusive evidence linking its use to an increased risk of skin cancer. \nHEALTHLINE\n\nThe primary benefit of sunscreens, including those containing oxybenzone, is their ability to protect against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a known cause of skin cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology emphasizes that using sunscreen is a critical component of skin cancer prevention strategies. \nHEALTHLINE\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about oxybenzone's potential endocrine-disrupting properties and its environmental impact, particularly on coral reefs. As a result, some regions have implemented bans on sunscreens containing oxybenzone. \nENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP\n\nIn summary, while oxybenzone is a widely used sunscreen ingredient, current evidence does not establish a direct link between its use and an increased risk of skin cancer. Nonetheless, ongoing research continues to evaluate its safety profile.

This approach leverages low-level optimizations and compiled code, resulting in significant performance improvements. \nSEBASTIAN RASCHKA\n\nInteroperability with C and Fortran: NumPy is designed to integrate seamlessly with C and Fortran code, allowing for the inclusion of high-performance routines written in these languages. This interoperability enables NumPy to execute complex numerical algorithms efficiently. \nNUMPY\n\nBroadcasting Capabilities: NumPy's broadcasting feature allows for operations on arrays of different shapes, automatically expanding them to match dimensions when necessary. This capability reduces the need for manual data alignment and enhances computational efficiency. \nED BENNETT\n\nThese features collectively make NumPy a powerful and efficient tool for scientific computing, enabling researchers and engineers to perform complex numerical computations with high performance.\n"}, "search_results": [{"link": "https://www.paulnorvig.com/guides/introduction-to-numpy-for-high-performance-computing.html", "title": "Introduction to NumPy for High Performance Computing (2024)", "description": "January 7, 2024 \u2014 Understanding NumPy and Its Role in High Performance Computing.
