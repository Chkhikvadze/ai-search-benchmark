The LHC Safety Study Group's 2003 report, which has been reaffirmed and expanded upon in subsequent evaluations, determined that high-energy particle collisions at the LHC, similar to those at other facilities like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), do not present any conceivable safety threats. This assessment has been supported by various reviews, including a comprehensive safety report published in 2008, which reiterated that the potential for dangerous phenomena, such as the creation of black holes, is unfounded. Overall, both the initial and updated safety assessments confirm that the operations of the LHC are completely safe, dismissing any public concerns regarding its experiments.", "search_results": [{"title": "The Safety of the LHC", "url": "https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider/safety-lhc", "description": "LSAG reaffirms and extends the conclusions of the 2003 report that LHC collisions present no danger and that there are no reasons for concern."}, {"title": "The safety of the LHC", "url": "https://public-archive.web.cern.ch/en/lhc/Safety-en.html", "description": "LSAG reaffirms and extends the conclusions of the 2003 report that LHC collisions present no danger and that there are no reasons for concern."}, {"title": "Safety of high-energy particle collision experiments", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_high-energy_particle_collision_experiments", "description": "In a report issued in 2003, they concluded that, like current particle experiments such as the RHIC, the LHC particle collisions pose no conceivable threat."}, {"title": "Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions", "url": "https://cern.ch/lsag/LSAG-Report.pdf", "description": "Their conclusions for strangelets, obtained in connection with heavy-ion collisions, apply with equal or greater force to proton-proton ..."}, {"title": "Review of the safety of LHC collisions", "url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-3899/35/11/115004", "description": "The safety of collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was studied in 2003 by the LHC Safety Study Group, who concluded that they presented no danger."}, {"title": "[0806.3414] Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3414", "description": "The safety of collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was studied in 2003 by the LHC Safety Study Group, who concluded that they presented no danger."}, {"title": "How dangerous is The Large Hadron Collider, CERN ...", "url": "https://www.quora.com/How-dangerous-is-The-Large-Hadron-Collider-CERN-which-is-the-worst-that-could-happen", "description": "If you managed to enter the tunnel of the LHC during it operation, then it would be very dangerous for you.
